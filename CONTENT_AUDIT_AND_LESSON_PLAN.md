**Slide 0: Do Now Quiz**
- **Status:** ✅ Level-appropriate difficulty
- **GCSE:** Basic recall questions (5 questions, multiple choice)
- **A-Level:** Same format (assessment appropriate for both levels at intro)
- **Differentiation:** Content-neutral knowledge check

**Slide 1: Introduction**
- **GCSE Content:** "Learn how psychologists plan their research by writing clear aims and testable predictions called hypotheses"
- **A-Level Content:** "Understand the fundamental principles of research design through the formulation of aims and the construction of falsifiable hypotheses within the hypothetico-deductive framework"
- **Status:** ✅ Properly differentiated

**Slide 2: Aims Interactive (AimsInteractive component)**
- **GCSE:**
  - Definition: "General statement explaining the purpose of a study"
  - Examples: Memory study, sleep research, social psychology studies
  - Key points: States what study is about, written as statement not question, broad overview
- **A-Level:**
  - Definition: "Broad statement of intent outlining research focus without specific outcome predictions"
  - Examples: Cognitive load, sleep deprivation, bystander effect (more technical)
  - Key points: Provides direction for methodology, identifies key variables, distinguishes exploratory from confirmatory research
- **Status:** ✅ Well differentiated

**Slide 3: Hypotheses Comparison (HypothesesComparison component)**
- **GCSE:**
  - Example: "To investigate whether background music affects concentration" (Aim) vs "Students who listen to music will remember fewer words" (Hypothesis)
  - Differences table: Simple aspects like Specificity, Prediction, Testing, Variables
- **A-Level:**
  - Example: Cognitive load study with operationalised terms
  - Differences table: Epistemology, Operationalisation, Statistical Testing, Theoretical Basis
- **Status:** ✅ Good differentiation, uses appropriate complexity

**Slide 4: Types of Hypotheses (HypothesisTypes component)**
- **GCSE:**
  - Alternative Hypothesis (H₁): "Predicts there WILL be a difference"
  - Null Hypothesis (H₀): "Predicts there will be NO difference"
- **A-Level:**
  - Alternative Hypothesis: "States that an effect, difference, or relationship exists. Forms basis for statistical testing"
  - Null Hypothesis: "Assumes no significant effect exists. Rejected when p < α (typically 0.05)"
  - Includes discussion of falsification and statistical implications
- **Status:** ✅ Properly differentiated - A-Level includes statistical context

**Slide 5: Mid-Lesson Knowledge Check (SplitKnowledgeCheck)**
- **GCSE Questions:** (4 questions)
  - "An aim is..." (defintion question)
  - "Which is more specific?" (comparison)
  - "The null hypothesis predicts..." (knowledge)
  - "The alternative hypothesis is also called..." (terminology)
- **A-Level Questions:** (4 questions)
  - "What is the key difference between aim and hypothesis?" (conceptual)
  - "A one-tailed hypothesis..." (terminology - directional vs non-directional)
  - "H₀ is rejected when..." (statistical knowledge)
  - "Operationalisation means..." (application)
- **Status:** ✅ Differentiated questions, appropriate difficulty levels

**Slide 6: Directional vs Non-Directional (DirectionalSlider component)**
- **GCSE:**
  - Directional: "Predicts the DIRECTION of the effect"
  - Non-Directional: "Predicts a difference but NOT the direction"
  - Examples: Simple language, relatable scenarios
- **A-Level:**
  - Directional: "Specifies direction of predicted effect - requires prior theoretical justification"
  - Non-Directional: "Predicts effect without direction - used when direction is uncertain"
  - Key points: Increased statistical power, placement of α in tails, requires theoretical basis
- **Status:** ✅ Good differentiation with statistical context for A-Level

#### LESSON 11: Advanced Methods (A-LEVEL ONLY) 🔬 PLANNED
**Curriculum Mapping:**
- AQA Year 13 (A2): Content analysis, case studies, meta-analysis

**A-Level Content (Year 13 only):**

**Case Studies:**
- In-depth investigation of single person/group/event
- Often longitudinal (over time)
- Methods: interviews, observations, tests
- Strengths: Rich detail, rare phenomena, hypothesis generation
- Weaknesses: Cannot generalize, subjective, time-consuming

**Content Analysis:**
- Coding qualitative material into themes
- Steps: Define research question → Sample material → Code → Categorize → Count → Analyze
- Quantifies qualitative data
- Strengths: Systematic, replicable
- Weaknesses: May lose nuance, coder bias

**Meta-Analysis:**
- Combining results across multiple studies
- Effect size estimation
- Strengths: Increased statistical power, generalizability
- Weaknesses: Publication bias, selective inclusion

**Research Reporting:**
- Standard sections: Abstract, Introduction, Method, Results, Discussion, References
- Appropriate statistics in results
- APA referencing format
- Limitations discussion
- Implications for theory and practice

**NOT FOR GCSE** - Year 13 A-Level only

**Target Slides: 10** | **Duration: ~80 minutes** | **Status: PLANNED - A-Level exclusive**

]

// Filtering function
const getActiveLessons = (currentLevel: 'gcse' | 'alevel') => {
  return allLessons.filter(lesson => lesson.levels.includes(currentLevel))
}
```

### User Experience

**When GCSE is selected:**
- Sidebar shows all 9 lessons (01-09)
- All lesson content uses GCSE language and concepts
- Color theme: 🟢 Green (GCSE)

**When A-Level is selected:**
- Sidebar shows all 9 lessons (01-09)
- All 9 lessons available (no hidden lessons)
- Lesson 1-9 content switches to A-Level language with advanced concepts
- Additional topics integrated: Research issues, pilot studies, mathematical content, statistical testing
- Color theme: 🔴 Rose/Red (A-Level)

**Switching between levels:**
- Progress is maintained when switching levels
- Theme changes with smooth transitions
- All lessons accessible at both levels
