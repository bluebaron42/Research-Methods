# 📘 Part 1: GCSE Research Methods Course
**Target Audience:** GCSE Students  
**Total Duration:** 8 Lessons (1 Hour Each)

## Lesson 1: The Basics of Investigation
**Topics:** Hypotheses & Variables
1.  **Hypotheses:** Definition, Null vs Alternative Hypotheses.
2.  **Variables:** Independent (IV), Dependent (DV).

4.  **Practice:** Identifying IV/DV in scenarios (e.g., Music & Learning).

## Lesson 2: Selecting Participants
**Topics:** Sampling Methods
1.  **Target Population:** Definition.
2.  **Methods:**
    *   **Random:** Equal chance, drawing from hat/computer.
    *   **Opportunity:** Available people, fast but biased.
    *   **Systematic:** Every 'nth' person, unbiased selection.
    *   **Stratified:** Sub-groups (strata) proportional to population.
    *   **Volunteer:** Self-selecting (e.g., adverts), motivation bias.
3.  **Evaluation:** Strengths and weaknesses of each.

## Lesson 3: Experimental Design
**Topics:** Experiments & Structured Design
1.  **Types of Experiment:** Laboratory, Field, Natural (definitions & strengths/weaknesses).
2.  **Experimental Designs:**
    *   **Independent Groups:** No order effects but participant variables.
    *   **Repeated Measures:** Eliminates participant variables but order effects (fatigue/practice).
    *   **Matched Pairs:** Reduces variables/no order effects, but time-consuming.
3.  **Procedures:** Standardised procedures, Random allocation, Counterbalancing (to fix order effects).

## Lesson 4: Non-Experimental Methods
**Topics:** Self-Repoort & Case Studies
1.  **Interviews:** Structured (pre-set questions) vs Unstructured (free discussion).
2.  **Questionnaires:** Open (qualitative) vs Closed (quantitative) questions. Social desirability bias.
3.  **Case Studies:** Detailed study of individual/group, longitudinal nature, difficulty generalizing.

## Lesson 5: Observation & Correlation
**Topics:** Watching & Measuring Relationships
1.  **Observations:** Natural vs Controlled behavior.
2.  **Reliability:** Inter-observer reliability (comparing records).
3.  **Correlations:**
    *   Definition: Association between two variables.
    *   Types: Positive, Negative, Zero.
    *   Scattergrams: Visualizing the data.
    *   Strength/Weakness: Can't establish cause & effect.

## Lesson 6: Ethical Considerations
**Topics:** BPS Guidelines
1.  **The Conflict:** Research needs vs Participant rights.
2.  **Key Issues:** Informed Consent, Deception, Protection from Harm, Right to Withdraw, Confidentiality/Anonymity.
3.  **Dealing with Issues:** Debriefing, Presumptive consent, Ethics committees.

## Lesson 7: Data Handling I
**Topics:** Types of Data & Averages
1.  **Data Types:** Quantitative vs Qualitative, Primary vs Secondary.
2.  **Measures of Central Tendency:**
    *   **Mean:** Add & divide.
    *   **Median:** Middle value.
    *   **Mode:** Most frequent.
3.  **Measure of Dispersion:** Range (Highest - Lowest).

## Lesson 8: Data Handling II
**Topics:** Maths & Graphs
1.  **Maths Skills:** Ratios, Fractions, Percentages.
2.  **Graphs:** Bar Charts (categories), Histograms (continuous), Scattergrams.
3.  **Distributions:** Normal Distribution (bell curve characteristics).

2.  **Scientific Features:** Replicability, Objectivity, Falsification (Popper).
3.  **Hypotheses:** Directional (One-tailed) vs Non-Directional (Two-tailed), Null vs Experimental.

## Lesson 2: Control & Validity
**Topics:** Managing the Study
1.  **Variables:** IV/DV, Extraneous vs Confounding variables.
2.  **Threats to Validity:** Demand Characteristics (Social desirability, "Screw you" effect), Investigator Effects.
3.  **Techniques:** Single-blind vs Double-blind procedures, Randomisation, Standardisation.

## Lesson 3: Advanced Experimental Design

4.  **Pilot Studies:** Purpose and importance.

## Lesson 4: Reliability & Validity (Deep Dive)
**Topics:** Quality Assessment
1.  **Reliability:** Inter-rater, Internal (consistency), External (Test-retest).
2.  **Validity Types:** Internal, External (Population, Ecological, Temporal), Face, Concurrent, Construct.
3.  **Improving them:** How to establish and check each type.

## Lesson 5: Ethics & Professional Standards
