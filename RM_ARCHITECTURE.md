# 🏗️ Research Methods: Adapted Lesson Architecture

This document outlines the modified 10-slide pedagogical structure designed specifically for Research Methods. It adapts the standard "Lesson-Builder" format to focus on **skills, application, and design** rather than theory and evidence.

## 📐 The Structure (10 Slides)

### 🟢 Phase 1: Activation
*   **Slide 0: Title & Concept**
    *   Visual icon representing the method/concept.
    *   Clear Learning Objective.
*   **Slide 1: Do Now (Retrieval Practice)**
    *   5 Questions from *previous* lessons.
    *   Focus: Terminology retention and spaced repetition.

### 🔵 Phase 2: Acquisition
*   **Slide 2: Core Concept (Definition)**
    *   What is it? (Definition of the method/technique).
    *   Key terminology (e.g., "Operationalisation", "Ecological Validity").
*   **Slide 3: Elaboration (Mechanics)**
    *   How does it work? (The procedure, calculation, or logical steps).
    *   Visual diagram or step-by-step breakdown.
*   **Slide 4: Understanding Check**
    *   5 Scenario-based questions.
    *   *Goal:* Can they identify the concept in valid research contexts?

### 🟣 Phase 3: Action (The "Minigame")
*   **Slide 5: Simulation / Activity (Interactive)**
    *   **The "Creative Core"**.
    *   A gamified task to *perform* the method.
    *   *Examples:* "Participant Selector", "Variable Hunter", "Scatterplot Builder".
*   **Slide 6: Simulation Review / Debrief**
    *   Feedback on the activity.
    *   What did the simulation show us about the difficulty/utility of this method?

### 🟠 Phase 4: Context (Refactored)
*   **Slide 7: Methodology in Context (Examples)**
    *   *Replaces "Evidence Grid".*
    *   **Content:** Famous studies that utilized this specific method.
    *   *Purpose:* Concrete examples of the method in action to anchor abstract concepts.
    *   *Example:* For **Field Experiments**, profile *Hofling et al. (Nurses)* or *Bickman (Uniforms)*.

### 🔴 Phase 5: Evaluation (Refactored)
*   **Slide 8: Method Evaluation (AO3)**
    *   *Replaces "Theory Evaluation".*
    *   **Content:** Strengths (Why use it?) vs. Limitations (What are the flaws?).
    *   **Key Themes:** Reliability, Validity (Internal/External), Ethics, Economy, Generalisability.

### ⚫ Phase 6: Assessment
*   **Slide 9: Exam Application**
    *   **Scenario Question:** "Design a study..." or "Explain one strength of..."
    *   Structure guidance (e.g., "State, Explain, Context").
    *   Model answer breakdown.
