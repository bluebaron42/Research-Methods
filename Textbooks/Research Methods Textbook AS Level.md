Experimental method

THE SPECIFICATION SAYS...
Experimental method.
Aims: stating aims, the difference between aims and hypotheses.
Hypotheses: directional and non-directional.

Aims

Researchers usually start with a general aim. The aim is a general statement of what the researcher intends to investigate; the purpose of the study.

Aims are developed from theories. For example, many people believe that watching violence on TV (or in video games) causes young people to be aggressive.

This is a theory. A researcher might then have the aim: To investigate whether watching violence on TV causes children to be aggressive.

Hypotheses

Once a researcher has decided on an aim they need to formulate a hypothesis. A hypothesis is a statement that is made at the start of a study and clearly describes the relationship between variables as stated by the theory.

For example, a researcher might make the statement: Drinking 'Speedy-uppy' causes people to become more talkative.

In a scientific experiment, the hypothesis can be more precise. For example: People who drink 'Speedy-uppy' are more talkative than people who do not drink 'Speedy-uppy'.

Directional and non-directional hypotheses

In the example above, the hypothesis is directional. It states the direction of the difference or relationship. For instance, in an experiment, the researcher might state that people who drink 'Speedy-uppy' will be more talkative than people who don't. Or less talkative. Or more aggressive. Or less aggressive. These are all directional hypotheses.

Directional hypotheses include words like more or less, higher or lower, faster or slower.

A non-directional hypothesis simply states that there is a difference between conditions or groups of people but, unlike in a directional hypothesis, the nature of the difference is not specified.

For instance, People who drink 'Speedy-uppy' differ in terms of talkativeness compared with people who do not drink 'Speedy-uppy'.

When to use which?

Psychologists tend to use a directional hypothesis when the findings of previous research studies suggest a particular outcome. For instance, if there was an earlier study that found 'Speedy-uppy' makes people talkative, you might predict the same direction for your study.

When there is no previous research, or findings from earlier studies are contradictory, psychologists will instead decide to use a non-directional hypothesis.

Variables

In an experiment, a researcher changes or manipulates the independent variable (IV) and records or measures the effect of this change on the dependent variable (DV). All other variables that might potentially affect the DV should remain constant in a properly run experiment. This is so the researcher can be confident that the cause of the effect on the DV was the IV and nothing else.

In our 'Speedy-uppy' example:

IV: whether participants drink 'Speedy-uppy' or water.

DV: how talkative they are.

Levels of the IV

In order to test the effect of the IV we need different experimental conditions. If we simply gave some participants 'Speedy-uppy' and measured their talkativeness, this wouldn't tell us much. We need a comparison.

We could compare participants who drink 'Speedy-uppy' with participants who drink water. The 'Speedy-uppy' condition and the 'water' condition are two levels of the IV. The control condition (water) is just as important as the experimental condition ('Speedy-uppy').

Operationalisation of variables

Psychologists are interested in studying many different things—some of them are not easy to measure. For instance, how might you measure 'talkativeness'? You can't just put a measuring tape round it.

The term operationalisation basically means clearly defining variables in terms of how they can be measured.

In our 'Speedy-uppy' example, we might operationalise 'talkativeness' by counting the number of words spoken in a five-minute period.

The IV also needs to be operationalised. We need to specify exactly what 'drinking Speedy-uppy' and 'drinking water' means—for example, 'drinking 300ml of Speedy-uppy' and 'drinking 300ml of plain water'.

After operationalisation, the hypothesis is: Participants who drink 300ml of Speedy-uppy speak more words in the five minutes following consumption than participants who drink 300ml of plain water.

So, operationalisation makes the hypothesis clear and testable.

Control of variables

THE SPECIFICATION SAYS...
Control of variables: extraneous and confounding variables; demand characteristics and investigator effects.
Randomisation and standardisation.

Extraneous variables

In an experiment, the only thing that should influence the DV is the IV. Any other variable that might interfere with the IV (or DV) should be controlled or removed. These are extraneous variables (EV).

The term 'extraneous variable' is a general term for any variable, other than the IV, that might affect the DV. Where EVs are important enough to cause a change in the DV, they become confounding variables.

Nuisance variables

Many EVs are straightforward to control. For example, the age of the participants, the lighting in the lab, etc. These are often described as 'nuisance variables' that do not vary systematically with the IV.

Nuisance variables might make it harder to detect a result (they 'muddy the waters'), but they are not confounding variables.

Confounding variables

Confounding variables change systematically with the IV. Let's say we are studying the effect of 'Speedy-uppy' on talkativeness. We have two groups: one drinks 'Speedy-uppy' and the other drinks water.

Imagine that the group drinking 'Speedy-uppy' are all naturally chatty people (extroverts) and the group drinking water are all quiet (introverts). If we find that the 'Speedy-uppy' group talks more, we can't be sure if it's because of the drink or because of their personality. Personality is a confounding variable.

Demand characteristics

Participants are not passive within experiments and they are likely to try to work out what is going on and what the researcher wants.

In our 'Speedy-uppy' experiment, participants might work out that we expect them to be more talkative if they have the energy drink. They may then act in a way that supports this hypothesis. This is the 'please-U effect'.

Alternatively, they may deliberately under-perform to sabotage the results. This is the 'screw-U effect'.

In either case, participant behaviour is no longer natural—it has changed to fit their interpretation of the investigation. Any cue from the researcher or from the research situation that may be interpreted by participants as revealing the purpose of the investigation is a demand characteristic.

Investigator effects

Participant reactivity (above) leads to investigator effects. This refers to any effect of the investigator's behaviour (conscious or unconscious) on the research outcome (the DV). This may include everything from the design of the study to the selection of, and interaction with, participants during the research process.

This could include things like leading questions (see page 59) or smiling more when interacting with some participants than others.

Coolican (2006) points out that investigator effects can include expectancy effects and unconscious cues. It might also refer to the physical characteristics of the investigator (e.g. gender, age).

Randomisation

To minimise the effect of extraneous/confounding variables on the outcome, researchers use randomisation.

Randomisation refers to the use of chance in order to control for the effects of bias when designing materials and deciding the order of conditions.

For example, in a memory experiment, participants might be given a list of words to learn. The order of the list should be randomly generated so that the position of each word is not decided by the experimenter.

In an experiment where participants take part in all conditions, the order of these conditions should be randomised.

Standardisation

As far as possible, all participants should be subject to the same environment, information and experience. To ensure this, all procedures are standardised.

This means making sure that all participants are subject to the same instructions and experience. To ensure this, a list of exactly what will be done in the study is prepared. This includes standardised instructions that are read to each participant.

Such standardisation means that non-standardised changes in procedure do not act as extraneous variables.

Experimental design

THE SPECIFICATION SAYS...
Experimental design: independent groups, repeated measures, matched pairs.
Evaluation of each of these designs.

Independent groups

In an independent groups design, participants are allocated to different groups where each group represents one experimental condition.

For example, if we wanted to study the effect of noise on concentration, we could have two groups:

Group A: Participants do a task with loud music playing (Condition A).

Group B: Participants do the same task with no music (Condition B).

The performance of the two groups would then be compared.

Evaluation

Order effects are not a problem: Participants only do the task once, so they don't get better through practice or worse through fatigue/boredom. They are also less likely to guess the aim.

Participant variables: The participants who occupy the different groups are not the same. If a researcher finds a mean difference between the groups on the DV this may be more to do with participant variables (individual differences) than the effects of the IV. To deal with this, researchers use random allocation.

Less economical: Twice as many participants are needed compared to a repeated measures design to get the same amount of data.

Repeated measures

In a repeated measures design, all participants take part in all conditions of the experiment.

Using the example above:

All participants would do the task with loud music (Condition A).

The same participants would later do the task with no music (Condition B).

The two sets of data would then be compared to see if there was a difference.

Evaluation

Participant variables: The person in both conditions has the same characteristics (intelligence, motivation, etc.). This controls this important CV.

Fewer participants: Half the number of participants is needed to get the same number of data points as independent groups.

Order effects: Order effects arise because repeating two tasks could create boredom or fatigue that might cause deterioration in performance on the second task. Alternatively, participants' performance may improve through the effects of practice, especially on a skill-based task. Order effects act as a confounding variable.

Demand characteristics: It is more likely participants will work out the aim of the study when they experience all conditions of the experiment.

Matched pairs

In a matched pairs design, pairs of participants are first matched on some variable(s) that may affect the DV. Then one member of the pair is assigned to Condition A and the other to Condition B.

For example, in a memory experiment, participants might be matched on IQ. This is an attempt to control for the confounding variable of participant variables.

Evaluation

Order effects and demand characteristics: Participants only take part in a single condition so order effects and demand characteristics are less of a problem.

Participant variables: Participants can never be matched exactly. Even when identical twins are used as matched pairs, there will still be important differences between them that may affect the DV.

Time-consuming and expensive: Matching participants is a time-consuming and expensive task, particularly if a pre-test is required, so this is less economical than other designs.

Random allocation

An attempt to control for participant variables in an independent groups design which ensures that each participant has the same chance of being in one condition as any other.

Counterbalancing

An attempt to control for the effects of order in a repeated measures design: half the participants experience the conditions in one order, and the other half in the opposite order.

Types of experiment

THE SPECIFICATION SAYS...
Types of experiment: laboratory and field experiments; natural and quasi-experiments.
Evaluation of each of these types of experiment.

Laboratory experiments

A laboratory experiment is conducted in a highly controlled environment. This is not necessarily a lab—it could be a classroom where conditions can be well controlled.

The researcher manipulates the IV and records the effect on the DV, whilst maintaining strict control of extraneous variables.

Strengths

Control: Lab experiments have high control over extraneous variables. This means the researcher can ensure that any effect on the DV is likely to be the result of manipulation of the IV. Thus, we can be more certain about demonstrating cause and effect (high internal validity).

Replication: Replication is more possible than in other types of experiment because of the high level of control. This ensures that new extraneous variables are not introduced when repeating an experiment. Replication is vital to check the results of any study to see whether the finding is valid and not just a one-off.

Limitations

Lack of generalisability: Lab experiments may lack generalisability. The lab environment may be rather artificial and not like everyday life. In an unfamiliar context participants may behave in unusual ways so their behaviour cannot always be generalised beyond the research setting (low external validity).

Demand characteristics: Participants are usually aware they are being tested in a lab experiment (though they may not know why) and this may give rise to 'unnatural' behaviour (demand characteristics).

Artificial tasks: The tasks participants are asked to carry out in a lab experiment may not represent real-life experience; for instance, recalling unconnected lists of words as part of a memory experiment (low mundane realism).

Field experiments

In field experiments, the IV is manipulated in a natural, more everyday setting (in the field, not in a lab). The researcher goes to the participants' usual environment rather than them coming to a lab.

Strengths

Higher realism: Field experiments have higher mundane realism than lab experiments because the environment is more natural. Thus field experiments may produce behaviour that is more valid and authentic. This is especially the case as participants may be unaware they are being studied (high external validity).

Limitations

Loss of control: There is a price to pay for increased realism due to the loss of control of extraneous variables. This means cause and effect between the IV and the DV may be much more difficult to establish and precise replication is often not possible.

Ethical issues: There are important ethical issues. If participants are unaware they are being studied they cannot consent to being studied and such research might constitute an invasion of privacy.

Natural experiments

Natural experiments are when the researcher takes advantage of a pre-existing independent variable. This kind of experiment is called 'natural' because the variable would have changed even if the experimenter was not interested.

Note that it is the IV that is natural, not necessarily the setting—participants may be tested in a lab.

An example is the study of the effects of institutionalisation in Romania (see page 90). The IV was adoption before or after the age of six months. This was not brought about by the researcher.

Strengths

Unique opportunities: Provide opportunities for research that might not otherwise be undertaken for practical or ethical reasons, such as the studies of institutionalised Romanian orphans.

High external validity: Natural experiments often involve the study of real-world issues and problems as they happen, such as the effects of a natural disaster on stress levels.

Limitations

Rare events: A naturally occurring event may happen very rarely, reducing the opportunities for research. This also may limit the scope for generalising findings to other similar situations.

Participants not randomly allocated: In a natural experiment, the researcher has no control over which participants are in which condition (as this is a pre-existing characteristic). This means the researcher may be less sure whether the IV affected the DV. For example, in the study of Romanian orphans, the IV was whether children were adopted early or late. However, there were lots of other differences between these groups, such as the children who were adopted later may have been less attractive/sociable than those adopted earlier.

Quasi-experiments

Quasi-experiments have an IV that is based on an existing difference between people (for instance, age or gender). No one has manipulated this variable, it simply exists.

For instance, if the anxiety levels of phobic and non-phobic patients were compared, the IV is 'having a phobia'. This is a quasi-experiment because the anxiety levels of the phobic and non-phobic participants are pre-existing.

Strengths

Controlled conditions: Quasi-experiments are often carried out under controlled conditions and therefore share the strengths of a lab experiment.

Limitations

Confounding variables: Like natural experiments, you cannot randomly allocate participants to conditions and therefore there may be confounding variables.

Sampling

THE SPECIFICATION SAYS...
Sampling: the difference between population and sample; sampling techniques including: random, systematic, stratified, opportunity and volunteer; implications of sampling techniques, including bias and generalisation.

Populations and samples

A population is the large group of individuals that a particular researcher may be interested in studying, for example, students in the South East, children with autism, men, or simply people. This is clearly too large a group to study, so the researcher selects a smaller group, called a sample.

This sample is drawn from the target population and is presumed to be representative of that population. In other words, the sample will stand for or represent the target population.

To the extent that the sample is representative, generalisations about the target population can be made. However, the vast majority of samples contain some degree of bias.

Sampling techniques

Random sampling

A random sample is a sophisticated form of sampling in which all members of the target population have an equal chance of being selected.

To select a random sample:

Obtain a complete list of all members of the target population.

All the names on the list are assigned a number.

The sample is generated through the use of some lottery method (computer-based randomiser or picking numbers from a hat).

Systematic sampling

A systematic sample is when every nth member of the target population is selected, for example, every 5th pupil on a school register.

A sampling frame is produced, which is a list of people in the target population organised into, for instance, alphabetical order. A sampling system is nominated (e.g. every 3rd, 6th or 8th person) or this interval may be determined randomly to reduce bias. The researcher then works through the sampling frame until the complete sample is generated.

Stratified sampling

A stratified sample is a sophisticated form of sampling in which the composition of the sample reflects the proportions of people in certain sub-groups (strata) within the target population or the wider population.

To select a stratified sample:

Identify the different strata that make up the population.

The proportions needed for the sample to be representative are worked out.

The participants that make up each stratum are selected using random sampling.

Opportunity sampling

Many researchers simply decide to select anyone who happens to be willing and available. The researcher simply takes the chance to ask whoever is around at the time of their study, for example in the street (as long as they fit the criteria you are looking for).

Volunteer sampling

A volunteer sample involves participants selecting themselves to be part of the sample; hence, it is also referred to as self-selection.

To select a volunteer sample a researcher may place an advert in a newspaper or on a common room notice board. Alternatively, willing participants may simply raise their hand when the researcher asks.

Evaluation of sampling techniques

Random sampling

Strengths: It is free from researcher bias. The researcher has no influence over who is selected and this prevents them from choosing people who they think may support their hypothesis.

Limitations: It is difficult and time-consuming to conduct. A complete list of the target population may be extremely difficult to obtain. Also, you may end up with a sample that is still unrepresentative—the laws of probability suggest that random sampling is likely to produce a more representative sample than, say, opportunity sampling, but it is still possible that the random method may select 20 female psychology teachers from Lancashire called Valerie. Finally, selected participants may refuse to take part, which means you end up with something more like a volunteer sample.

Systematic sampling

Strengths: This method avoids researcher bias. Once the system for selection has been established the researcher has no influence over who is chosen.

Limitations: It is usually fairly representative. For example, it would be quite unlucky to get an all-male sample unless the list was organised in a particular way.

Stratified sampling

Strengths: Avoids researcher bias. Once the target population has been sub-divided into strata, the participants that make up the numbers are randomly selected and beyond the influence of the researcher. Also, produces a representative sample because it is designed to accurately reflect the composition of the population. This means that generalisation of findings becomes possible.

Limitations: Stratification is not perfect. The identified strata cannot reflect all the ways that people are different, so complete representation of the target population is not possible.

Opportunity sampling

Strengths: Opportunity sampling is convenient. This method saves a researcher a good deal of time and effort and is much less costly than, say, random sampling.

Limitations: Two forms of bias. First, the sample is unrepresentative of the target population as it is drawn from a very specific area, such as one street in one town, so findings cannot be generalised to the target population. Second, the researcher has complete control over the selection of participants and, for instance, may avoid people they do not like the look of (researcher bias).

Volunteer sampling

Strengths: Collecting a volunteer sample is easy. It requires minimal input from the researcher and is less time-consuming than other forms of sampling. The researcher ends up with participants who are more engaged, more so than someone who was stopped in the street.

Limitations: Volunteer bias is a problem. Asking for volunteers may attract a certain 'profile' of person, that is, one who is helpful, curious and likely to try to please the researcher. This might affect how far findings can be generalised.

Ethical issues and ways of dealing with them

THE SPECIFICATION SAYS...
Scientific processes: Ethical issues and ways of dealing with them.
The British Psychological Society (BPS) code of ethics.

Ethical issues

Ethical issues arise in Psychology when a conflict exists between the rights of participants in research studies and the goals of research to produce authentic, valid and worthwhile data.

The BPS code of ethics is a quasi-legal document produced by the British Psychological Society (BPS) that instructs psychologists in the UK about what behaviour is and is not acceptable when dealing with participants. It is built around four major principles: respect, competence, responsibility and integrity.

Informed consent

This involves making participants aware of the aims of the research, the procedures, their rights (including the right to withdraw their participation at any time), and also what their data will be used for. Participants should then make an informed judgement whether or not to take part without being coerced or feeling obliged.

From the researcher's point of view, asking for informed consent may make the study meaningless because participants' behaviour will not be 'natural' as they know the aims of the study.

Deception

Deception means deliberately misleading or withholding information from participants at any stage of the investigation. This is linked to the above; participants who have not received adequate information when they agreed to take part (or have been lied to) cannot be said to have given informed consent.

However, there are occasions when deception can be justified if it does not cause the participant undue distress. For instance, in drug trials, if participants knew whether they had received the real drug or the placebo, this knowledge would affect the validity of the results.

Protection from harm

As a result of their involvement, participants should not be placed at any more risk than they would be in their daily lives, and should be protected from physical and psychological harm. This includes being made to feel embarrassed, inadequate or being placed under undue stress or pressure.

An important feature of protection from harm is participants being reminded of the fact that they have the right to withdraw from the investigation at any point.

Privacy and confidentiality

Participants have the right to control information about themselves. This is the right of privacy. If this is invaded then confidentiality should be protected. Confidentiality refers to our right, enshrined in law under the Data Protection Act, to have any personal data protected.

The right to privacy extends to the area where the study took place such that institutions or geographical locations are not named.

Ways of dealing with ethical issues

BPS code of ethics

The BPS code of ethics includes a set of ethical guidelines. Researchers have a professional duty to observe these guidelines when conducting research. They won't be sent to prison if they don't follow them, but they may lose their job. The guidelines are closely matched to the ethical issues above and attempt to ensure all participants are treated with respect and consideration during each phase of research.

Guidelines are implemented by ethics committees in research institutions (such as universities) who use a cost-benefit approach to determine whether particular research proposals are ethically acceptable.

Dealing with informed consent

Participants should be issued with a consent letter or form detailing all relevant information that might affect their decision to participate. Assuming the participant agrees, this is then signed. For investigations involving children under 16, a signature of parental consent is required.

Dealing with deception and protection from harm

At the end of a study, participants should be given a full debrief. Participants should be made aware of the true aims of the investigation and any details they were not supplied with during the study, such as the existence of other groups or experimental conditions.

Participants should also be told what their data will be used for and must be given the right to withhold data if they wish. This is particularly important if retrospective consent is a feature of the study.

Participants should be reassured that their behaviour was normal and natural. In extreme cases, if participants have been subject to stress or embarrassment, they may require counselling, which the researcher should provide.

Dealing with confidentiality

If personal details are held these must be protected. However, it is more usual to simply record no personal details, i.e. maintain anonymity. Researchers usually refer to participants using numbers or initials when writing up the investigation.

In a case study, psychologists often use false names/initials to protect the identity of the individual (e.g. HM, Little Hans).

Alternative ways of getting consent

Presumptive consent: Rather than getting consent from the participants themselves, a similar group of people are asked if the study is acceptable. If this group agrees, then the consent of the original participants is 'presumed'.

Prior general consent: Participants give their permission to take part in a number of different studies, including one that will involve deception. By consenting, participants are effectively consenting to be deceived.

Retrospective consent: Participants are asked for their consent (during debriefing) having already taken part in the study. They may not have been aware of their participation or they may have been subject to deception.

Pilot studies (and more)

THE SPECIFICATION SAYS...
Pilot studies and the aims of piloting.

Pilot studies

A pilot study is a small-scale trial run of the actual investigation. It involves a handful of participants, rather than the total number, in order to 'road-test' the procedure and check the investigation runs smoothly.

It is important to recognise that a pilot study is not the same as the 'real' study. It is a small-scale version.

Aims of piloting

The main aim of a pilot study is to identify any potential issues and to modify the design or procedure, saving time and money in the long run.

In experimental research, for example, a pilot study may help to determine whether the task is too hard or too easy (a 'floor' or 'ceiling' effect), or whether the time allowed for the task is sufficient.

In observational studies, a pilot study provides a way of checking coding systems before the real study is undertaken. This may be an important part of training observers.

In self-report methods, such as questionnaires or interviews, it is helpful to try out questions in advance and remove or reword those that are ambiguous or confusing.

Single-blind and double-blind procedures

We have already encountered demand characteristics (page 169) and how these might act as a confounding variable in an experiment.

One way to control for demand characteristics is to use a single-blind procedure. Here, participants are not told the aim of the research at the beginning of the study. As well as this, other details may be kept from participants, such as which condition of the experiment they are in or whether there is another condition at all.

This is essentially an attempt to control for the confounding effects of demand characteristics.

In a double-blind procedure neither the participants nor the researcher who conducts the study is aware of the aims of the investigation (often a third party conducts the investigation without knowing its main purpose). Double-blind procedures are often an important feature of drug trials. Treatment may be administered to patients by someone who is independent of the investigation and who does not know which drugs are real and which are placebos.

In this case, the double-blind procedure protects against both demand characteristics and investigator effects (see page 169).

Control groups and conditions

We have used the term control group (or condition) at various points in this chapter. For example, in a drug trial, the group that receives the real drug is the experimental group and the group that receives the placebo is the control group.

The word 'control' is used in research in many different ways (e.g. control of variables). We use a control group (in an independent groups design) or control condition (in a repeated measures design) for the purpose of comparison. If the change in behaviour of the experimental group is significantly greater than that of the control group, then the researcher can conclude that the cause of this effect was the independent variable (assuming all other confounding variables have remained constant).

Observational techniques

THE SPECIFICATION SAYS...
Observational techniques: naturalistic and controlled observation; covert and overt observation; participant and non-participant observation.
Evaluation of each of these techniques.

Types of observation

Naturalistic and controlled observations

Naturalistic observations take place in the setting or context where the target behaviour would usually occur. For instance, it would make sense to study how employees in a factory interact with each other in the factory environment rather than in a research lab. All aspects of the environment are free to vary.

Controlled observations are useful when a researcher wants to control certain variables. In the factory example, the researcher might want to know how the employees interact when the manager is present. This would be difficult to set up in a real-world environment without affecting the naturalness of the behaviour. Therefore, some control over variables, including manipulating variables to observe effects and also control of extraneous variables, is needed.

Evaluation

Naturalistic: Tend to have high external validity as they involve the study of behaviour where it would normally occur. The findings can often be generalised to everyday life. However, the lack of control over the research situation makes replication of the investigation difficult. There may also be many uncontrolled extraneous variables that make it more difficult to judge any pattern of behaviour.

Controlled: Controlled observations (usually) may produce findings that cannot be as readily applied to real-life settings. Confounding variables may be less of a factor so replication of the observation becomes easier.

Covert and overt observations

In covert observations, the participants are unaware they are the focus of the study and their behaviour is observed in secret, say from across the room or a balcony. Such behaviour must be public and happening anyway if the observation is to be ethical.

In overt observations, participants know their behaviour is being observed and have given their informed consent beforehand.

Evaluation

Covert: The main advantage of covert observation is that it removes the problem of participant reactivity (see page 169) and ensures any behaviour observed will be natural. This increases the validity of the data gathered. However, the ethics of these studies may be questioned as people, even in public, may not wish to have their behaviours noted down.

Overt: Overt observations have the advantage of being more ethically acceptable but the knowledge participants have that they are being observed may act as a significant influence on their behaviour.

Participant and non-participant observations

Sometimes it may be necessary for the observer to become part of the group they are studying, for instance, if the researcher wants to produce a first-hand account of the group's activities. This is participant observation.

In most cases, the observer remains separate from the group they are studying and records behaviour in a more objective manner. This is non-participant observation. It may often be impractical or even impossible to join particular groups so that non-participation is the only option—such as a middle-aged female researcher observing behaviour in a Year 10 boys' dormitory at a boarding school.

Evaluation

Participant: The researcher can experience the situation as the participants do; giving them increased insight into the lives of the people being studied. This may increase the validity of the findings. However, there is a danger that the researcher may identify too strongly with those they are studying and lose objectivity. Some researchers refer to this as 'going native'—when the line between being a researcher and being a participant becomes blurred.

Non-participant: Non-participant observations allow the researcher to maintain an objective psychological distance from their participants so there is less danger of them 'going native'. However, they may lose the valuable insight to be gained in a participant observation as they are too far removed from the people and behaviour they are studying.

Observational design

THE SPECIFICATION SAYS...
Observational design: behavioural categories; event sampling; time sampling.
Inter-observer reliability.

Structured and unstructured observation

Occasionally, a researcher may simply want to write down everything they see. This is referred to as an unstructured observation and tends to produce accounts of behaviour that are rich in detail. This method may be appropriate when observations are small in scale and involve few participants.

However, often there is too much going on in a single observation for the researcher to record it all. Therefore, it is necessary to simplify the target behaviours that will become the main focus of the investigation using structured observation. Structured observations allow the researcher to quantify their observations using a pre-determined list of behaviours and sampling methods.

Evaluation

Structured: Structured observations that involve the use of behavioural categories make the recording of data easier and more systematic. The data produced is likely to be numerical which means that analysing and comparing the behaviour observed between participants is more straightforward.

Unstructured: Unstructured observations tend to produce qualitative data, which may be much more difficult to record and analyse. There is also a greater risk of observer bias with unstructured observations, as the objective behavioural categories that are a feature of structured observations are not present here. Researchers may record those behaviours that 'catch their eye' and these may not be the most important or useful.

Behavioural categories

In order to produce a structured record of what a researcher sees (or hears), it is first necessary to break the target behaviour up into a set of behavioural categories (sometimes referred to as a behavioural checklist). This is very similar to the idea of operationalisation (see page 167).

For instance, the target behaviour 'affection' may be broken down into observational categories such as hugging, kissing, smiling, holding hands, etc.

There should be no need for inferences to be made, such as 'being sad'. Two observers might interpret this differently and thus it would not be a reliable category. 'Crying' would be better.

To ensure that your categories are objective, you should:

Be operationalised: The categories should be precisely defined so that all observers know exactly what to look for.

Not overlap: For instance, smiling and grinning would be very difficult to distinguish.

Cover all possible behaviours: If a behaviour occurs that is not on the list, it cannot be recorded.

Sampling methods

Continuous recording of behaviour is a key feature of unstructured observations in which all instances of a target behaviour are recorded. However, for very complex behaviours, this method may not be practical or feasible. In structured observations, the researcher must use a systematic way of sampling their observations:

Event sampling: A target behaviour or event is first established then the researcher records this event every time it occurs. For example, counting the number of times players smile in a football match.

Time sampling: A target individual or group is first established then the researcher records their behaviour in a fixed time frame, say, every 60 seconds. For example, recording what a specific football player is doing every 30 seconds.

Evaluation

Event sampling: Event sampling is useful when the target behaviour or event happens quite infrequently and could be missed if time sampling was used. However, if the specified event is too complex, the observer may overlook important details if using event sampling.

Time sampling: Time sampling is effective in reducing the number of observations that have to be made. However, those instances when behaviour is sampled might be unrepresentative of the observation as a whole.

Inter-observer reliability

Single observers may miss important details or may only notice events that confirm their opinions or hypothesis. This introduces bias into the research process. To make data recording more objective and unbiased, observations should be carried out by at least two researchers.

However, it is important that pairs of observers are consistent in their judgements and that any data they record is the same or very similar.

Observers must be trained to establish inter-observer reliability. This may involve:

Observers should familiarise themselves with the behavioural categories to be used.

They then observe the same behaviour at the same time, perhaps as part of a small-scale pilot study.

Observers should compare the data they have recorded and discuss any differences in interpretation.

Finally, observers should analyse the data from the study. Inter-observer reliability is calculated by correlating each pair of observations made. An overall figure is produced (usually at least +0.8) which indicates high inter-observer reliability.

Self-report techniques

THE SPECIFICATION SAYS...
Self-report techniques: questionnaires; interviews, structured and unstructured.
Evaluation of these techniques.

Questionnaires

Questionnaires involve a pre-set list of written questions (or items) to which the participant responds. Psychologists use questionnaires to assess thoughts and/or feelings.

A questionnaire may be used as part of an experiment to assess the dependent variable. For example, to determine whether views on legalising marijuana differ between older and younger people.

Open and closed questions

Open questions: An open question does not have a fixed range of answers and respondents are free to answer in any way they wish. For example, "How do you feel when you see a spider?" Open questions tend to produce qualitative data that contains a wide range of different responses but may be difficult to analyse.

Closed questions: A closed question offers a fixed number of responses. For example, "Do you smoke?" (Yes/No). Or, "On a scale of 1 to 10, how afraid of spiders are you?" Closed questions produce quantitative data which is easy to analyse but may lack depth and detail.

Evaluation of questionnaires

Cost-effective: They can gather large amounts of data quickly because they can be distributed to large numbers of people.

Straightforward to analyse: Especially if closed questions are used, the data is easy to convert into graphs and charts for comparison.

Response bias: Respondents may not always be truthful. They may want to present themselves in a positive light (social desirability bias) or they may just answer 'yes' to everything (acquiescence bias).

Misunderstanding: There is a risk that respondents may misunderstand questions or interpret them differently to the researcher.

Interviews

An interview is a 'live' encounter (face-to-face or on the phone) where an interviewer asks a set of questions to assess an interviewee's thoughts and/or experiences. The questions may be pre-set (as in a questionnaire) or may develop as the interview progresses.

Structured interviews

Structured interviews are made up of a pre-determined set of questions that are asked in a fixed order. This is like a questionnaire but conducted face-to-face (or over the phone) in real time.

Unstructured interviews

An unstructured interview works a lot like a conversation. There are no set questions. There is a general aim that a certain topic will be discussed, and interaction tends to be free-flowing. The interviewee is encouraged to expand and elaborate their answers as prompted by the interviewer.

Semi-structured interviews

Many interviews are likely to fall somewhere between the two types described above. There is a list of questions that have been worked out in advance but interviewers are also free to ask follow-up questions when they feel it is appropriate.

Evaluation of interviews

Structured interviews:

Strength: Straightforward to replicate due to their standardised format. The format also reduces differences between interviewers.

Limitation: It is not possible for interviewers to deviate from the topic or elaborate their points, and this may be a source of frustration for some.

Unstructured interviews:

Strength: There is much more flexibility. The interviewer can follow up points as they arise and is much more likely to gain insight into the worldview of the interviewee.

Limitation: Analysis of data from unstructured interviews is not straightforward. The researcher may have to sift through much irrelevant information and drawing firm conclusions may be difficult. There is also the risk that interviewees may lie for reasons of social desirability. However, a skilled interviewer should be able to establish sufficient rapport with the participant so that even when sensitive and personal topics are discussed, any responses given are more truthful.

Self-report design

THE SPECIFICATION SAYS...
Self-report design: designing and writing questions.
Questionnaire construction.

Designing and writing good questions

Designing a questionnaire or interview schedule (the list of questions) involves more than just thinking up some questions!

Likert scales

A Likert scale is one in which the respondent indicates their agreement (or otherwise) with a statement using a scale of usually five points. The scale ranges from strongly agree to strongly disagree.

For example:
Zombies are awesome.
Strongly agree (5) - Agree (4) - Neutral (3) - Disagree (2) - Strongly disagree (1)

Rating scales

A rating scale works in a similar way but gets respondents to identify a value that represents their strength of feeling about a particular topic.

For example:
How entertaining do you find zombie movies?
Very entertaining 1 2 3 4 5 Not entertaining at all

Fixed choice option

Includes a list of possible options and respondents are required to indicate those that apply to them.

For example:
Why do you watch zombie movies? (Tick all that apply)
[ ] For the gore
[ ] To see people get eaten
[ ] For the plot
[ ] Because my friends do
[ ] I don't

Designing interviews

Most interviews involve an interview schedule, which is the list of questions that the interviewer intends to cover. This should be standardised for each participant to reduce the effect of interviewer bias.

Typically, the interviewer will take notes throughout the interview, or alternatively, the interview may be recorded and analysed later.

Interviews usually involve a single participant and a single interviewer (though group interviews may be appropriate in clinical settings).

In the case of a one-to-one interview, the interviewer should conduct the interview in a quiet room, away from other people, as this will increase the likelihood that the interviewee will open up.

It is good practice to begin with some neutral questions to make the participants feel relaxed and comfortable and as a way of establishing rapport.

Designing questionnaires

Overuse of jargon

Jargon refers to technical terms that are only familiar to those within a specialised field or area. For instance, the following question would be confusing to anyone who is not a psychologist: "Do you agree that maternal deprivation in infancy leads to affectionless psychopathy?"

The best questions are simple and easily understood.

Emotive language and leading questions

Sometimes, the author's attitude towards a particular topic is clear from the way in which the question is phrased.

For example: "Boxing is a barbaric sport and any sane person would want it banned. Do you agree?"

This is a leading question as it guides the respondent towards a particular answer.

Emotive language (such as 'barbaric' and 'sane') should be replaced with more neutral alternatives.

Double-barrelled questions

A double-barrelled question contains two questions in one.

For example: "Do you agree with this statement: Premiership footballers are overpaid and should give 20 per cent of their wages to charity."

Respondents may agree with one half of the question but not the other.

Double negatives

Questions that include double negatives can be difficult for respondents to decipher.

For example: "I am not unhappy in my job. Agree/Disagree"

It is better to phrase the question straightforwardly: "I am happy in my job."

Apply it

Concepts: Self-report design

Look at the following questions and identify the flaw in each one.

(a) "Do you agree that young people today are lazy and disrespectful?"

(b) "How much do you enjoy reading books and watching films?"

(c) "Do you think that people who drive fast cars are compensating for something?"

(d) "I don't think that people shouldn't smoke in public places. Agree/Disagree"

Rewrite each of the questions above to make them better.

Correlations

THE SPECIFICATION SAYS...
Correlations: analysis of the relationship between co-variables.
The difference between correlations and experiments.
Positive, negative and zero correlations.

Analysis of the relationship between co-variables

Correlations illustrate the strength and direction of an association between two or more co-variables (e.g. height and weight).

Correlations are plotted on a scattergram (or scatterplot). One co-variable represents the x-axis and the other the y-axis. Each point or dot on the graph corresponds to the x and y position of the co-variables.

Types of correlation

Positive correlation: As one co-variable increases the other co-variable increases. For example, the number of people in a room and noise are positively correlated.

Negative correlation: As one co-variable increases the other co-variable decreases. For example, the number of people in a room and amount of personal space are negatively correlated.

Zero correlation: There is no relationship between the co-variables. For example, the number of people in a room in Manchester and the total daily rainfall in Peru.

Coefficients of correlation

Researchers use a statistical test to calculate the correlation coefficient. This is a number between -1 and +1 that represents the direction and strength of a relationship between co-variables.

+1 represents a perfect positive correlation.

-1 represents a perfect negative correlation.

0 means there is no correlation.

The closer the coefficient is to +1 or -1, the stronger the relationship between the co-variables.

The difference between correlations and experiments

In an experiment, the researcher controls or manipulates the independent variable (IV) in order to measure the effect on the dependent variable (DV). As a result of this deliberate change in one variable it is possible to infer that the IV caused any observed changes in the DV.

In contrast, in a correlation, there is no such manipulation of one variable and therefore it is not possible to establish cause and effect between one co-variable and another.

Even if we found a strong positive correlation between 'Speedy-uppy' and talkativeness, we could not assume that the drink caused the talkativeness. It could be that people who talk a lot get thirsty and drink more 'Speedy-uppy' (causality is the other way round). Or, there may be another untested variable that is causing both things to change, called an intervening variable. For instance, being in a social situation might cause people to talk more and drink more.

Evaluation of correlations

Strengths:

Correlations provide a precise and quantifiable measure of how two variables are related. This may suggest ideas for possible future research if variables are strongly related or demonstrate an interesting pattern.

They are often used as a starting point to assess possible patterns between variables before researchers commit to an experimental study.

They are relatively quick and economical to carry out. There is no need for a controlled environment and no manipulation of variables is required. Secondary data (e.g. government statistics) can be used, which means correlations are less time-consuming than experiments.

Limitations:

As a result of the lack of experimental manipulation and control within a correlation, studies can only tell us how variables are related but not why.

Correlations cannot demonstrate cause and effect between variables and therefore we do not know which co-variable is causing the other to change.

Another untested variable may be causing the relationship between the two co-variables we are interested in (the third variable problem).

Correlations can occasionally be misused or misinterpreted. In the media, relationships between variables are sometimes presented as causal 'facts' when in reality they may not be.

Data analysis: Kinds of data

THE SPECIFICATION SAYS...
Quantitative and qualitative data; primary and secondary data.
Meta-analysis.

Quantitative and qualitative data

Quantitative data is data that is expressed numerically.

Data collection techniques such as experiments usually produce quantitative data (e.g. how many words a person can recall).

Closed questions in questionnaires also produce quantitative data (e.g. 'How many hours a week do you exercise?').

Observational studies produce quantitative data when behavioural categories are used (e.g. how many times a child pushes another child).

Qualitative data is data that is expressed in words and is non-numerical (although qualitative data can be converted to numbers for the purposes of analysis).

Data collection techniques such as unstructured interviews produce qualitative data (e.g. a transcript of an interview).

Open questions in questionnaires also produce qualitative data (e.g. 'Describe how you felt when you saw the spider').

Unstructured observations produce qualitative data (e.g. a diary account of a child's behaviour).

Evaluation

Quantitative data:

Strength: Simple to analyse, therefore comparisons between groups can be easily drawn. Also, data in numerical form tends to be more objective and less open to bias.

Limitation: Is much narrower in scope and meaning than qualitative data and thus may fail to represent 'real-life'.

Qualitative data:

Strength: Offers much more richness of detail than quantitative data. It is much broader in scope and gives the participant/respondent more licence to develop their thoughts, feelings and opinions on a given subject. For this reason, it tends to have greater external validity than quantitative data; it provides the researcher with a more meaningful insight into the participant's worldview.

Limitation: Is often difficult to analyse. It can be hard to identify patterns and comparisons between groups are hard to draw. Conclusions often rely on the subjective interpretations of the researcher and these may be subject to bias.

Primary and secondary data

Primary data

Primary data is data that has been collected first-hand by the researcher for the purposes of the research project. In other words, data is gathered directly from participants as part of an experiment, self-report or observation.

Secondary data

Secondary data is data that has already been collected by someone else. In other words, the data has typically already been subjected to statistical testing and thus the significance is known.

Examples of secondary data include the work of other psychologists or government statistics (e.g. census data).

Evaluation

Primary data:

Strength: Authentic data obtained from the participants themselves for the purpose of the investigation. Questionnaires and interviews, for instance, can be designed in such a way that they specifically target the information that the researcher requires.

Limitation: Requires time and effort on the part of the researcher. For example, planning an experiment, recruiting participants, etc., takes considerable planning, preparation and resources.

Secondary data:

Strength: May be inexpensive and easily accessed requiring minimal effort. When examining secondary data the researcher may find that the desired information already exists and so there is no need to conduct primary data collection.

Limitation: There may be substantial variation in the quality and accuracy of secondary data. Information may appear to be valuable at first sight but, on further investigation, may be outdated or incomplete. The content of the data may not quite match the researcher's needs or objectives.

Meta-analysis

Meta-analysis refers to a process where researchers collect and collate a wide range of previously conducted research on a specific area. Collated research is reviewed together.

This may involve a qualitative review of conclusions and/or a quantitative analysis of the results.

Meta-analysis allows us to view data with much more confidence and generalise findings across much larger populations.

However, meta-analysis may be prone to publication bias (sometimes referred to as the file drawer problem). The researcher may not select all relevant studies, choosing to leave out those with negative or non-significant results. Therefore the data from the meta-analysis will be biased because it only represents some of the relevant data and incorrect conclusions are drawn.

Data analysis: Descriptive statistics

THE SPECIFICATION SAYS...
Descriptive statistics: measures of central tendency - mean, median, mode; calculation of mean, median and mode; measures of dispersion - range and standard deviation; calculation of range; calculation of percentages; positive, negative and zero correlations.

Measures of central tendency

Measures of central tendency give us information about the 'average' values for a set of data.

Mean

The mean (arithmetic average) is calculated by adding up all the scores in a data set and dividing by the total number of scores.

Strength: It is the most sensitive of the measures of central tendency as it includes all of the scores in the data set within the calculation. This means it is more representative of the data as a whole.

Limitation: It is easily distorted by extreme values (outliers).

Median

The median is the middle value in a data set when scores are arranged from lowest to highest.

Strength: Extreme scores do not affect it. It is also easy to calculate.

Limitation: It is less sensitive than the mean as the actual values of lower and higher numbers are ignored and extreme values may be important.

Mode

The mode is the most frequently occurring score in a data set.

Strength: It is very easy to calculate. For some data (categorical data) it is the only method you can use.

Limitation: It is a very crude measure. It is not very representative of the data as a whole.

Measures of dispersion

Measures of dispersion describe the spread of data or how far scores vary and differ from one another.

Range

The range is a simple calculation of the dispersion in a set of scores which is worked out by subtracting the lowest score from the highest score and adding 1 (as a mathematical correction).

Strength: It is easy to calculate.

Limitation: It only takes into account the two most extreme values, and this may be unrepresentative of the data set as a whole.

Standard deviation

Standard deviation is a single value that tells us how far scores deviate (move away from) the mean.

A low standard deviation indicates that the data points tend to be close to the mean (less spread out).

A high standard deviation indicates that the data points are spread out over a wider range of values.

Strength: It is a much more sophisticated measure of dispersion than the range as it includes all the scores in the calculation.

Limitation: Like the mean, it can be distorted by a single extreme value. Also, it is more complicated to calculate than the range.

Calculation of percentages

To calculate a percentage:

$$\text{Percentage} = \left(\frac{\text{Part}}{\text{Whole}}\right) \times 100$$

For example, if 15 participants out of 60 were female:

$$\left(\frac{15}{60}\right) \times 100 = 25\%$$

Data can be represented continuously (e.g. 1, 2, 3, 4...) or divided into categories (discrete data). Bar charts are used when data is divided into categories, otherwise known as discrete data.

In a bar chart, the categories are plotted on the x-axis and the frequency (or amount) on the y-axis. The bars are separated to denote that we are dealing with separate categories.

Histograms

In a histogram, the bars touch each other, which shows that the x-axis data is continuous (rather than discrete).

The x-axis is made up of equal-sized intervals of a single category, for instance, percentage scores in a maths test broken down into 0-9, 10-19, 20-29, etc. The y-axis represents the frequency (number of people) within each interval.

Scattergrams

We have already come across scattergrams in the section on correlations (page 188). They depict associations between co-variables.

Line graphs

Line graphs represent continuous data and use points connected by lines to show how something changes in value, for instance, over time. Typically, the IV is plotted on the x-axis and the DV on the y-axis.

Distributions

Normal distribution

If you measure a certain variable, such as height, within a population, the frequency of these measurements should form a bell-shaped curve. This is called a normal distribution, which is symmetrical.

Most people are located in the middle area of the curve, with very few people at the extreme ends. The mean, median and mode all occupy the same mid-point of the curve. The 'tails' of the curve, which extend outwards, never touch the x-axis (and are therefore asymptotic) as more extreme scores are theoretically possible.

Skewed distributions

Not all distributions form a balanced symmetrical pattern. Some data sets derived from psychological scales or measurements may produce skewed distributions, that is, distributions that appear to lean to one side or the other.

Positive skew: This is where most of the distribution is concentrated towards the left of the graph, resulting in a long tail on the right. For example, a very difficult test in which most people got low marks would produce a positive skew. In a positively skewed distribution, the mode is at the highest point of the peak, the median comes next, and the mean has been dragged across to the right (towards the tail).

Negative skew: A very easy test would produce a distribution where the bulk of the scores are concentrated on the right, resulting in the long tail on the left. This is a negative skew. The mean is pulled to the left this time (due to lower scores who are in the minority), with the mode at the highest peak and the median in the middle.

Arithmetic and numerical computation

Sign test

The sign test is a statistical test used to analyse the difference in scores between related items (e.g. the same participant tested twice). Data should be nominal or better.

To conduct the sign test:

State the hypothesis: Identify whether it is directional (one-tailed) or non-directional (two-tailed).

Record the data: Record the data and work out the sign of the difference between each pair of data (+ or -). If there is no difference, the data point is ignored.

Calculate the value of S: S is the sum of the less frequent sign.

Find the critical value: Use a critical value table. You need to know:

N: The total number of scores (excluding those with no difference).

Whether the hypothesis is one-tailed or two-tailed.

The significance level (usually p $\leq$ 0.05).

Compare S with the critical value: For the result to be significant, the calculated value of S must be equal to or less than the critical value.

Data handling and algebra

Probability and significance

All statistical testing is based on probability—the likelihood that a pattern of results could have arisen by chance.

The accepted level of probability in psychology is 0.05 (or 5%). This is the level at which the researcher decides to accept the research hypothesis or not. This is written as p $\leq$ 0.05.

This means there is a less than 5% probability that the results occurred by chance. In other words, we can be 95% certain that the difference or relationship is real.

In some cases, researchers need to be more confident that results were not due to chance (e.g. in drug trials where human cost is involved) and so employ a stricter and more stringent significance level of 0.01 (1%).

Critical values

When a statistical test has been calculated, the result is a number—the calculated value (or observed value). To check for significance, this calculated value is compared with a critical value—a number that tells us how significant the result is.

To find the critical value you need to know:

N: The number of participants (or degrees of freedom).

Whether the hypothesis is one-tailed (directional) or two-tailed (non-directional).

The significance level (usually 0.05).

Concepts: Mathematical content

A researcher conducts a sign test and calculates a value of S = 3. The total number of participants (N) was 12. The hypothesis was two-tailed and the significance level was 0.05. Using the critical value table below, determine whether the result is significant.

Introduction to statistical testing

THE SPECIFICATION SAYS...
Introduction to statistical testing: the purpose of statistical testing; the sign test.

The purpose of statistical testing

Statistical tests are used to determine whether a significant difference or correlation exists (and consequently, whether the null hypothesis should be rejected or retained).

The concept of significance

If a statistical test is significant, it means that the probability that the observed effect occurred by chance is low enough for us to reject the null hypothesis and accept the alternative hypothesis.

As mentioned in the previous section, the standard level of significance in psychology is 0.05 (5%).

The sign test

The sign test is a simple statistical test used to determine whether there is a significant difference between two sets of scores.

Conditions for use:

We need to be looking for a difference rather than an association.

We need to have used a repeated measures design.

We need data that is organised into categories (known as nominal data).

Interpretation of significance

When we perform a statistical test, we calculate a value (the calculated value). We then compare this value to a critical value found in a table of critical values.

For the sign test, the calculated value (S) must be equal to or less than the critical value for the result to be regarded as significant.

Peer review and psychology and the economy

THE SPECIFICATION SAYS...
Peer review: the role of peer review in the scientific process; the implications of psychological research for the economy.

Peer review

Peer review is the assessment of scientific work by others who are specialists in the same field to ensure that any research intended for publication is of high quality.

The main aims of peer review:

To allocate research funding: Independent peer reviews take place to decide whether or not to award funding for a proposed research project.

To validate the quality and relevance of research: All elements of research are assessed for quality and accuracy: the formulation of hypotheses, the methodology chosen, the statistical tests used and the conclusions drawn.

To suggest amendments or improvements: Reviewers may suggest minor revisions of the work and thereby improve the report. In extreme cases, they may conclude that the work is inappropriate for publication and should be withdrawn.

Evaluation of peer review

Anonymity: It is usual practice that the 'peer' doing the reviewing remains anonymous throughout the process as this is likely to produce a more honest appraisal. However, a minority of reviewers may use their anonymity as a way of criticising rival researchers who they perceive as having crossed them in the past! This is made all the more likely by the fact that many researchers are in direct competition for limited research funding. For this reason, some journals favour open reviewing whereby the names of the reviewer(s) are made public.

Publication bias: It is a natural tendency for editors of journals to want to publish significant 'headline grabbing' findings to increase the credibility and circulation of their publication. This means that research which does not meet these criteria is ignored or disregarded. This creates a false impression of the current state of psychology if journal editors are being selective about what they publish.

Burying ground-breaking research: The peer review process may suppress opposition to mainstream theories, wishing to maintain the status quo within particular scientific fields. Reviewers tend to be critical of research that contradicts their own view and much more favourable to that which matches it. Thus, peer review may have the effect of slowing down the rate of change within a particular scientific discipline.

Psychology and the economy

The implications of psychological research for the economy

Psychology is not just an academic discipline; the findings of psychological research have real-world implications, including for the economy.

Attachment research into the role of the father
Bowlby's World Health Organisation report in the 1950s suggested that babies needed the constant care of a mother for healthy psychological development. This led to 'stay at home' mothering. Later evidence has shown that fathers can be primary attachment figures and that good quality childcare does not damage development.

Economic implication: This means that mothers can return to work, contributing to the economy through tax payments and increased productivity.

The development of treatments for mental illness
Absence from work costs the economy an estimated £15 billion a year. A third of all absences are caused by mild to moderate mental health disorders such as depression, anxiety and stress. Psychological research into the causes and treatments of mental illness has an important role to play in supporting a healthy workforce.

Economic implication: Patients are able to have their condition diagnosed quickly and gain access to effective treatments, such as psychotherapeutic drugs and therapies (e.g. CBT). This means that sufferers can manage their condition effectively and return to work. Thus the economic benefit of psychological research into disorders such as depression is considerable.
