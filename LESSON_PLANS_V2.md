# 🎓 New Lesson Plans (Textbook-Based)

These lesson plans are designed to be 1 hour long and use content STRICTLY from the provided textbooks.

## 📝 GCSE Lesson Plan: "Foundation of Research Methods"

**Duration:** 60 Minutes  
**Source:** [GCSE Research Methods.txt](Textbooks/GCSE%20Research%20Methods.txt)

### 1. Introduction: Hypotheses (10 mins)
*   **Content:** Define a hypothesis as a formal and testable statement.
*   **Key Terms:**
    *   **Null Hypothesis:** Statement of no impact/relationship (e.g., "watching television before bed has no impact on sleep").
    *   **Alternative Hypothesis:** Prediction that one variable affects the other (e.g., "watching scary movies before bed affects sleep").
*   **Reference:** [GCSE Research Methods.txt](Textbooks/GCSE%20Research%20Methods.txt#L104-L141)

### 2. Variables: IV, DV & Extraneous (15 mins)
*   **Content:** Breakdown of the 3 types of variables.
*   **Independent Variable (IV):** What is manipulated (e.g., music in a learning study).
*   **Dependent Variable (DV):** The outcome/measured effect (e.g., test scores).
*   **Extraneous Variables:** "Nuisance variables" that unknowingly affect the outcome (e.g., prior knowledge, intelligence).
*   **Reference:** [GCSE Research Methods.txt](Textbooks/GCSE%20Research%20Methods.txt#L159-L215)

### 3. Sampling Methods (20 mins)
*   **Content:** Strategies to get representative samples from a target population.
*   **Methods:**
    *   **Random:** Equal chance for all (draw from hat/computer).
    *   **Opportunity:** Asking whoever is available (fast but biased).
    *   **Systematic:** Selecting every "nth" member (unbiased but time-consuming).
    *   **Stratified:** Sub-groups (strata) in proportion to the population (very representative but complex).
*   **Activity:** Discuss strengths and weaknesses of each.
*   **Reference:** [GCSE Research Methods.txt](Textbooks/GCSE%20Research%20Methods.txt#L231-L329)

### 4. Practice & Plenary (15 mins)
*   **Worksheet:** Students identify IV and DV in 3 scenarios.
*   **Discussion:** Why do we aim for "representative samples"? (To allow for generalizations).

## 📝 A Level Lesson Plan: "Science, Validity, and Research Design"

**Duration:** 60 Minutes  
**Source:** [A level Research Methods.txt](Textbooks/A%20level%20Research%20Methods.txt)

### 1. Psychology as a Science (10 mins)
*   **Content:** Compare two viewpoints.
*   **Scientific View:** Uses little bits of behavior, labs, nomothetic laws (universal), and quantitative data.
*   **Non-Scientific View:** Ideographic laws (unique), real-world behavior, qualitative data, and free will.
*   **Reference:** [A level Research Methods.txt](Textbooks/A%20level%20Research%20Methods.txt#L40-L67)

### 2. Features of Scientific Method (15 mins)
*   **Key Features:**
    *   **Replicability:** Ability to repeat and get same results.
    *   **Objectivity:** Bias-free measurements.
    *   **Falsification (Popper):** Attempting to disprove a finding.
    *   **Deductive vs Inductive:** Formulating hypotheses vs gaining insights first.
*   **Reference:** [A level Research Methods.txt](Textbooks/A%20level%20Research%20Methods.txt#L72-L100)

### 3. Reliability and Validity (25 mins)
*   **Reliability:** Consistently measuring the variable (Inter-rater, Internal, External/Test-retest).
*   **Validity:** Does it measure what it's designed to measure?
    *   **Internal:** Control within the study.
    *   **External:** Generalizability (Population and Ecological validity).
    *   **Content/Face Validity:** Does it "look" right?
    *   **Construct Validity:** Does it fit what we know?
*   **Reference:** [A level Research Methods.txt](Textbooks/A%20level%20Research%20Methods.txt#L175-L225)

### 4. Application & Ethics (10 mins)
*   **Factors Governing Choice:** Ideology, nature of question, stage of research (pilot studies).
*   **Ethics:** Quick review of BPS guidelines (Informed consent, protection from harm, right to withdraw, debrief, etc.).
*   **Reference:** [A level Research Methods.txt](Textbooks/A%20level%20Research%20Methods.txt#L102-L125, L236-L255)
